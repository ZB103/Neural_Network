# Neural_Network
Two variations of a simple, hand-crafted neural network.
The first variation uses a small, pre-determined weight and bias set in order to confirm the effective learning of the algorithm.
The second variation uses a large database and random weights and biases in order to demonstrate the neural network's use on a larger scale. It features a CLI and the ability to save and load files of desired weights and biases, or to re-roll randomly.
